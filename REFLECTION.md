Noticeable segmentation difference/performance when lighting changes! Shuffle + Otsu f.ex. works well when lighting changes in the scene, whereas the static sampling is less reactive when the lighting changes

Other example of this can be seen here:

Also mentioned in the DARPA Grand Challenge Paper from 2005, where the "adaptive approach is necessary" (section 1.6 Computer Vision Terrain Analysis)
