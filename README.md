# Real-time learning and segmentation
Welcome to this lab in the computer vision course [TEK5030] at the University of Oslo.
In this lab we will experiment with real time image segmentation on image streams from a camera or a prerecorded video.

**Start** by cloning this repository on your machine.

If you want to use prerecorded video, you can download the [videos]
(259MB) and unzip them somewhere convenient on your computer[&ast;](#terminal).

Then, open the project in PyCharm.
If you are uncertain about how this is done, please take a look at [the intro lab].

The lab is carried out by following these steps:

1. [Get an overview](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md)
2. [Implement simple color-based segmentation](lab-guide/2-implement-simple-color-based-segmentation.md)
3. [Further work](lab-guide/3-further-work.md)

Please start the lab by going to the [first step](lab-guide/1-get-an-overview.md).
